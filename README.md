# ipfs-pin-steem

> A tool for pinning Steem content from Dtube,Dlive,Dsound,Steepshot to your IPFS node.


## Requirements
* `python3.6`
* `ipfsapi`
* `beem`(optional)
* `steem`(optional)

## Installation
Install with pip.
It's recommended to install a steem library (`beem` or `steem`), but not required since it's not easy to install them on Windows.

```
pip install ipfs-pin-steem
```

or (recommended)

`pip install ipfs-pin-steem[beem]` or 

`pip install ipfs-pin-steem[steem]`

or build from source

```
git clone https://github.com/Johnn3y/ipfs-pin-steem
cd ipfs-pin-steem
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
cli-Knowledge required. Run `ipfs-pin-steem --help` for more details. 

`url` can look e.g. like `https://d.tube/v/user/permlink` or just `user/permlink`.


To simply pin a post run:

```
ipfs-pin-steem url
```
To pin multiple posts:

```
ipfs-pin-steem url1 url2 url3
```

To wrap all hashes to a single ipfs object, run:

```
ipfs-pin-steem url --object
```

If you don't want to pin e.g. snaphash and spritehash, simply run:

```
ipfs-pin-steem url --exclude snaphash spritehash
```

If you don't want to pin anything and just create the object, run:

```
ipfs-pin-steem url --object --no-pin
```


If your IPFS Node is not on your local machine or you changed the port, you can simply run:

```
ipfs-pin-steem url --api 127.0.0.1 --port 5001
```
